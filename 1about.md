Hi! I am Biomedical Engineer in the [Movement Disorders Group](https://www.ibis-sevilla.es/investigacion/neurociencias/trastornos-del-movimiento/mir-rivera-pablo.aspx){:target="_blank"} at the [Institute of Biomedicine of Seville](https://www.ibis-sevilla.es/inicio.aspx?lang=en-US){:target="_blank"}. I am developing my PhD in the Medicine Department with a fellowship from the University of Seville. My PhD is focused on the analysis of neuroimaging as biomarkers to detect complications associated with the progression of Parkinson's disease. In addition, I integrate other types of (molecular or genetic) biomarkers to the neuroimage-based analysis. About my academic background, I received my Master's degree in Biomedical Research in 2018, my Master's degree in Data Science & Big Data in 2017 and my Bachelor's degree in Healthcare Engineering from the University of Seville. Moreover, I did an internship in the [Computer Lab](https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~pms69/group.html){:target="_blank"} at the University of Cambridge in 2018. I enjoy solving complex problems through innovative methods in the field of neuroscience. I like working with creativity in multidisciplinary teams (formed by physicians, biologists, biotechnologists, engineers, among others) to find the best solutions and to communicate the obtained knowledge in a concise way. You have my cv by here...

Outside of the lab, I enjoy making electronic music, working out in the gym, and loving the sun at Seville. :)
